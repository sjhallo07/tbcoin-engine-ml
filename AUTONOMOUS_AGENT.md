Purpose
-------
This document and package provide a scaffold for building an autonomous trading agent that combines large language models, reinforcement learning, pattern recognition, blockchain interaction, strategy orchestration, and a continuous self-improvement loop.

Files added
-----------
- `app/autonomous_agent/` - package root
- `app/autonomous_agent/core/` - LLM, RL, pattern recognition
- `app/autonomous_agent/blockchain/` - smart contract, wallet, tx simulation
- `app/autonomous_agent/strategies/` - strategy manager and risk manager
- `app/autonomous_agent/self_improvement/` - learning loop

Next steps
----------
- Implement concrete LLM wrappers (openai/other) and configs
- Connect RLAgent to training environment and logging
- Integrate with existing blockchain gateway in repository
- Implement strategy modules and backtest harness
- Add more unit and integration tests
