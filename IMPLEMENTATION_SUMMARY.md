### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Application Lifecycle Management
- **Startup/Shutdown Orchestration**: Sequential handler execution
- **Signal Handling**: Proper SIGTERM/SIGINT handling with thread-safe event loop integration
- **Health Monitoring**: Configurable health checks with status reporting
- **Uptime Tracking**: Automatic uptime calculation
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Reverse-order cleanup with error handling

#### 2. ML Model Lifecycle Management
- **Dynamic Loading**: Load models on-demand with configurable loaders
- **Version Management**: Support for multiple model versions simultaneously
- **Hot-Swapping**: Zero-downtime model updates
- **Usage Tracking**: Automatic usage statistics
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Remove unused models based on age
- **Metadata Tracking**: Track load time, usage count, last access

#### 3. Resource Lifecycle Management
- **Resource Types**: Register custom resource types with initializers/cleaners
- **Health Checks**: Per-resource health monitoring
- **Automatic Initialization**: Lazy or eager resource initialization
- **Proper Cleanup**: Guaranteed cleanup on shutdown
- **State Tracking**: Monitor resource states throughout lifecycle

#### 4. Configuration Management
- **LifecycleConfig**: Centralized configuration class
- **Configurable Timeouts**: Startup/shutdown timeouts
- **Cleanup Intervals**: Configurable model cleanup intervals
- **Health Check Settings**: Configurable health check frequency

### Testing
- **28 unit tests** covering all modules
- **83% code coverage** overall
- Tests for:
  - State management
  - Application lifecycle
  - Model lifecycle (loading, unloading, hot-swapping)
  - Resource lifecycle (initialization, cleanup, health checks)
  - Async/sync handler support
  - Error handling

### Code Quality
- **CodeQL Security Scan**: ✓ Passed (0 vulnerabilities)
- **Code Review**: ✓ Passed (all issues addressed)
  - Fixed signal handler thread safety
  - Fixed state management ordering
  - Improved error handling

### Documentation
- **LIFECYCLE.md**: 8KB comprehensive guide including:
  - Features overview
  - Quick start examples
  - Architecture diagrams
  - API reference
  - Best practices
  - Configuration guide
- **Inline Documentation**: All modules, classes, and methods documented
- **Example Application**: Complete working example demonstrating all features

## Architecture

```

    LifecycleManager (Core)
        ↓
    ┌───┴───┬─────────────┐
    ↓       ↓             ↓
  Models  Resources  HealthChecks
```

### State Flow
```
UNINITIALIZED → INITIALIZING → READY → STARTING → RUNNING → STOPPING → STOPPED
                                                     ↓
                                                   ERROR
```

## Usage Example

```python
from lifecycle import LifecycleManager, ModelLifecycleManager

# Initialize managers
app = LifecycleManager(app_name="tbcoin-engine")
models = ModelLifecycleManager()

# Register handlers
app.add_startup_handler(load_models)
app.add_shutdown_handler(cleanup)
app.add_health_check("models", check_models)

# Run application
await app.startup()
# ... application logic ...
await app.shutdown()
```

## Testing Results

All tests pass successfully:
```
28 passed in 0.24s
Coverage: 83%
```

Test categories:
- State management: 3 tests
- Application lifecycle: 7 tests
- Model lifecycle: 8 tests
- Resource lifecycle: 10 tests

## Security

- No vulnerabilities detected by CodeQL
- Thread-safe signal handling
- Proper resource cleanup
- No leaked credentials or secrets

## Performance Considerations

- Async/sync handler support for performance
- Lazy loading of models to save memory
- Automatic cleanup of unused resources
- Non-blocking health checks

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Dependency Injection**: Handlers registered externally
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Separate managers for different lifecycle aspects
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling in all managers
4. **Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging
5. **Type Safety**: Type hints throughout
6. **State Management**: Clear state transitions
7. **Resource Safety**: Guaranteed cleanup

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Potential areas for future enhancement:
- Distributed lifecycle management across multiple nodes
- Metrics collection and export (Prometheus, etc.)
- Advanced model versioning with A/B testing support
- Resource pooling optimizations
- Event-driven lifecycle hooks
- Integration with container orchestration (Kubernetes)

## Conclusion

Successfully implemented a production-ready lifecycle management system that provides:
- ✅ Complete application lifecycle control
- ✅ Sophisticated ML model management
- ✅ Robust resource management
- ✅ Comprehensive testing (28 tests)
- ✅ Security validated (CodeQL passed)
- ✅ Well-documented (8KB+ documentation)
- ✅ Example application demonstrating all features

The implementation is ready for production use in the TBCoin Engine ML backend.
